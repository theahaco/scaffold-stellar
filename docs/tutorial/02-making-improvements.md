# Making Some Basic Improvements

In our initial version, we had a problem: the `guess` function would crash if no number was set yet. Let's fix this by improving how our contract initializes and by creating reusable code for number generation.

## What We'll Accomplish

By the end of this step, you'll have:

- A contract that sets a number immediately upon deployment
- A private helper function for generating random numbers
- A more robust `reset` function that uses our helper
- Better error handling in the `guess` function

## Understanding the Problem

In our current contract, the `__constructor` only sets the admin, but doesn't set an initial number. This means:

1. If someone calls `guess` before `reset`, it will crash with `unwrap()` on `None`
2. The number generation logic is only in `reset`, making it hard to reuse

Let's fix these issues!

## Step 1: üîí Create a Private Helper Function

First, let's extract the number generation into a private helper function. This follows the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) and makes our code more maintainable.

Open `contracts/guess-the-number/src/lib.rs` and add this private function inside the `impl GuessTheNumber` block:

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl GuessTheNumber {
    // ... existing functions ...

    /// Private helper function to generate and store a new random number
    fn set_random_number(env: &Env) {
        let new_number: u64 = env.prng().gen_range(1..=10);
        env.storage().instance().set(&THE_NUMBER, &new_number);
    }
}
```

### Understanding Private Functions

Notice that this function doesn't have `pub` in front of it - this makes it private. Private functions:

- Can only be called from within the same contract
- Don't become part of the contract's public API
- Are useful for internal logic and code reuse
- Help keep your contract interface clean and focused

## Step 2: üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Update the Constructor

Now let's modify the `__constructor` to set an initial number when the contract is deployed:

```rust
pub fn __constructor(env: &Env, admin: &Address) {
    Self::set_admin(env, admin);
    Self::set_random_number(env); // Add this line
}
```

### Why This Improves Things

By setting a number in the constructor:

1. **Immediate functionality**: The contract works right after deployment
2. **No crash risk**: `guess` will never encounter a missing number
3. **Better user experience**: Players can start guessing immediately

## Step 3: ‚ôªÔ∏è Update the Reset Function

Let's simplify our `reset` function to use the new helper:

```rust
/// Update the number. Only callable by admin.
pub fn reset(env: &Env) {
    Self::require_admin(env);
    Self::set_random_number(env);
}
```

Much cleaner! The logic is now centralized in our helper function. Note that this is still a public function, see the `pub`? The distinction between "public" and "private" might seem confusing here. Let's run the application and it should clear everything up:

```bash
$ npm start
```

In the header menu, you should see a `</> Debugger` link. This will open up our handy dandy Contract Explorer. This will let you explore all the contracts within your project, view the documentation for every method, and even invoke them with arguments directly from the UI!

This is a great tool to help debug and test while you develop. So give it a shot! Navigate to the debugger, select the `guess_the_number` contract, and test out our new `reset` method by hitting it's `Submit` button.

Our `reset` method is available to be called by code _outside_ our contract because we opted in to it being a public method with the `pub`. Our `set_random_number` is private by default, it's not even visible to the outside world. It's not listed in the Contract Explorer. It's not listed in the CLI help either:

```bash
$ stellar contract invoke --id guess_the_number --source me --network local -- help
Commands:
  reset    Update the number. Only callable by admin.
  guess    Guess a number between 1 and 10
  upgrade  Upgrade the contract to new wasm. Only callable by admin.
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

It would error if you tried to invoke it:

```bash
$ stellar contract invoke --id guess_the_number --source me --network local -- set_random_number
error: unrecognized subcommand 'set_random_number'
```

### Wait, So Anyone Can Call Reset?

Nope! Just because we made it public, we still require authentication so only admins can call it. Rust's idea of public vs private handles "where" the functions can be called. You still need to handle "who" calls it. That's why we set the contract admin in it's constructor method and check it with `Self::require_admin(env);`. Let's test it out and create a non-admin identity to see how it fails:

```bash
$ stellar keys generate bob --network local --fund
‚úÖ Key saved with alias bob in ".config/stellar/identity/bob.toml"
‚úÖ Account bob funded on "Standalone Network ; February 2017"

$ stellar contract invoke --id guess_the_number --source bob --network local -- reset
‚ùå error: Missing signing key for account GDAQWVA6REGN47BBCFY6SGQ4YTIGMDZZFHDOVUZXMVRAAT6OEZGCACGH
```

Alice is the admin, Bob is just a regular user. She can call `reset`, he gets an error.

## Step 4: ‚ö†Ô∏è Improve Error Handling

Speaking of errors, we should provide some helpful messages instead of just breaking when things go wrong. Let's make the `guess` function more robust by replacing `unwrap()` with `expect()`:

```rust
/// Guess a number between 1 and 10
pub fn guess(env: &Env, a_number: u64) -> bool {
    let stored_number = env.storage()
        .instance()
        .get::<_, u64>(&THE_NUMBER)
        .expect("No number has been set");

    a_number == stored_number
}
```

### Understanding `expect()` vs `unwrap()`

Because [Rust distinguishes between two types of errors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html), there's two different ways to handle them. Some errors are from bugs, and obviously we want to avoid these as much as possible. But some errors are expected. And we can recover from them without crashing. Both of these methods are shortcuts to check for values and error, but one gives you the ability to explain _why_:

- `unwrap()`: Crashes with a generic error message
- `expect()`: Crashes with your custom error message

Both will panic if the value is `None`, but `expect()` gives better debugging info. In our case, this should never happen since we now set a number in the constructor, but it's good defensive programming. For example, we were already using it in our `require_admin` method for authentication.

## Step 5: Your Complete Updated Contract

Here's what your `lib.rs` should look like now:

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, symbol_short, Address, BytesN, Env, Symbol};

#[contract]
pub struct GuessTheNumber;

const THE_NUMBER: Symbol = symbol_short!("n");
pub const ADMIN_KEY: &Symbol = &symbol_short!("ADMIN");

#[contractimpl]
impl GuessTheNumber {
    pub fn __constructor(env: &Env, admin: &Address) {
        Self::set_admin(env, admin);
        Self::set_random_number(env);
    }

    /// Update the number. Only callable by admin.
    pub fn reset(env: &Env) {
        Self::require_admin(env);
        Self::set_random_number(env);
    }

    /// Guess a number between 1 and 10
    pub fn guess(env: &Env, a_number: u64) -> bool {
        let stored_number = env.storage()
            .instance()
            .get::<_, u64>(&THE_NUMBER)
            .expect("No number has been set");

        a_number == stored_number
    }

    /// Private helper function to generate and store a new random number
    fn set_random_number(env: &Env) {
        let new_number: u64 = env.prng().gen_range(1..=10);
        env.storage().instance().set(&THE_NUMBER, &new_number);
    }

    /// Upgrade the contract to new wasm. Only callable by admin.
    pub fn upgrade(env: &Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
        Self::require_admin(env);
        env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash);
    }

    fn admin(env: &Env) -> Option<Address> {
        env.storage().instance().get(ADMIN_KEY)
    }

    fn set_admin(env: &Env, admin: &Address) {
        // Check if admin is already set
        if env.storage().instance().has(ADMIN_KEY) {
            panic!("admin already set");
        }
        env.storage().instance().set(ADMIN_KEY, admin);
    }

    fn require_admin(env: &Env) {
        let admin = Self::admin(env).expect("admin not set");
        admin.require_auth();
    }
}

mod test;
```

## Step 6: üß™ Test Your Improvements

Let's test that our improvements work. You should still have the `npm start` process running from earlier. If not, run it again and we can look a little closer at what it's doing. There's two concurrent processes:

1. `stellar scaffold watch --build-clients`: watches for any changes in your `contracts/` folders, then rebuilds and redeploys them
2. `vite`: watches for any changes in your `src/` folder and hot-reloads the UI

That means any time you add a method, tweak arguments, or even add documentation, everything is immediately reflected on the local network, your application in the browser, and in the Contract Explorer. Let's add some info to the `guess` method's documentation:

```rust
    /// Guess a number between 1 and 10, inclusive. Returns a boolean.
    pub fn guess(env: &Env, a_number: u64) -> bool {
```

As soon as you hit save, watch the Contract Explorer reload with the new text. Nifty, right? This massively speeds up your development time. But we can go even further.

### How to Write Unit Tests

TODO

## What We've Learned

In this step, we covered several important concepts:
1. Code Organization
	- **Private functions**: Help organize code and prevent external access to internal logic
	- **DRY principle**: Don't repeat yourself - extract common logic into reusable functions
2. Contract Lifecycle
	- **Immediate functionality**: Contracts should work right after deployment
	- **Consistent state**: Always ensure your contract is in a valid state
	- **Graceful degradation**: Handle edge cases so your contract doesn't crash
3. Error Handling
	- **expect() vs unwrap()**: Better error messages help with debugging

Our contract is now much more robust:

- ‚úÖ Works immediately after deployment
- ‚úÖ Clean, reusable code structure
- ‚úÖ Better error handling
- ‚ùå Still no authentication (anyone can guess)
- ‚ùå Still no transactions (how do you win the prize? what prize?)

## What's Next?

In the next step, we'll tackle authentication by:

- Converting `guess` from a view function to a transaction
- Requiring users to be signed in to guess
- Adding a `guesser` parameter to track who made each guess

This will prepare us for adding economic incentives in later steps!
