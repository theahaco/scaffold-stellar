# Scaffold Stellar Tutorial

This tutorial will help you learn how to use [Scaffold Stellar](https://github.com/theahaco/scaffold-stellar) to build and manage a decentralized application (dApp) and smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain. Scaffold Stellar is a developer toolkit that provides CLI tools, contract templates, and a starter React UI to get your idea out of your head and on to the network as fast as possible.

It's split into four sections:
1. [Getting Started](./01-getting-started.md): will help you setup your development environment, initialize a new project, and explain the architecture and contract code
2. [Making Improvements](./02-making-improvements.md): will explain the front-end architecture and more CLI tooling to get you used to the workflow
3. [Adding Transactions](./03-adding-transactions.md): will show examples of working with real transactions of XLM
4. [Best Practices](./04-best-practices.md): will add some final polish to our contract to make sure everything is ready to be deployed to production

Well, what are you waiting for? [Get started!](./01-getting-started.md)
