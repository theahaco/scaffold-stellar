**Scaffold Stellar** is a developer toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on the [**Stellar** blockchain](https://stellar.org).

It helps you go from **idea** to **working full-stack dApp** faster â€” by providing CLI tools, reusable contract templates, a smart contract registry, and a modern frontend.

---

## Why Use Scaffold Stellar?

- Simplifies blockchain dApp development
- Generates smart contract projects and React UIs
- Deploys smart contracts and manages versions
- Easy to learn for newcomers; powerful for pros

---

## What Is Stellar?

[**Stellar**](https://www.stellar.org/) is a blockchain designed for fast, low-cost financial transactions and smart contracts written in **Rust** and compiled to **WebAssembly (Wasm)**.

With Scaffold Stellar, you write smart contracts in Rust and interact with them using modern TypeScript + React tooling.

## **Quickstart** (New Developers Welcome!)

This section walks you through setting up Scaffold Stellar from scratch.

### 1. Install the Scaffold Stellar CLI

```
cargo install --locked stellar-scaffold-cli
```

The Scaffold Stellar CLI is installed as a plugin under the `stellar` CLI.

> We recommend the use of [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install pre-compiled binaries.

### 2. Create a New Project
```
stellar scaffold init my-project
cd my-project
```

### 3. Configure Your Frontend Environment

Edit `.env` with your preferred network, and other settings.

### 4. Install Frontend Dependencies
```
# Install Frontend dependencies
npm install
```
### 5. Start Development
```
npm run dev
```
You should see your React frontend at http://localhost:5173.

### 6. For testnet/mainnet deployment:
```
# First publish your contract to the registry
stellar registry publish --wasm path/to/contract.wasm --wasm-name my-contract

# Then deploy an instance with constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name my-contract-instance \
  --wasm-name my-contract \
  -- \
  --param1 value1

# Can access the help docs for constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name my-contract-instance \
  --wasm-name my-contract \
  -- \
  --help

# Install the deployed contract locally for use with stellar-cli
stellar registry install my-contract-instance
```

## Project Layout
After scaffolding a project, your folder structure will look like this:

```
my-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/            # Rust smart contracts (compiled to WASM)
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/             # Auto-generated TypeScript contract clients
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                  # Frontend application
|   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json      # Frontend packages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/              # React source code
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # Reusable UI pieces
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/    # Contract interaction logic
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx       # Main app component
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.tsx      # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ environments.toml     # Configuration per environment (dev/test/prod)
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                  # Local environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Workspace packages
â”œâ”€â”€ target/               # Build outputs
```

This template provides a ready-to-use frontend application with example smart contracts and their TypeScript clients. You can use these as reference while building your own contracts and UI. The frontend is set up with `Vite`, `React`, and includes basic components for interacting with the contracts.

See the [CLI Documentation](https://github.com/theahaco/scaffold-stellar/blob/main/docs/cli.md) for detailed command information and the [Environments Guide](https://github.com/theahaco/scaffold-stellar/blob/main/docs/environments.md) for configuration details.

## CLI Tools
Scaffold Stellar provides two main CLI tools:

**stellar-scaffold**
Initialize and manage dApp projects:
```
stellar scaffold init my-project
stellar scaffold build
```

**stellar-registry**
Manage contract deployment and versions:
```
stellar registry publish --wasm contract.wasm --wasm-name my-contract    # Publish contract to the registry
stellar registry deploy --contract-name instance --wasm-name my-contract # Deploy a contract instance
stellar registry install my-contract-instance                           # Install deployed contracts locally
```
> Use `--help` on any command for usage instructions.

---
## Smart Contract Deployment

### 1. Publish Your Contract
```bash
# Publish with automatic metadata extraction
stellar registry publish --wasm target/stellar/local/my_contract.wasm

# Or specify details manually
stellar registry publish \
  --wasm target/stellar/local/my_contract.wasm \
  --wasm-name my-contract \
  --binver "1.0.0"
```

### 2. Deploy the Contract
```bash
# Deploy without initialization
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name my-contract-instance \
  --wasm-name my-contract

# Deploy with constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name my-token \
  --wasm-name token \
  --version "1.0.0" \
  -- \
  --name "My Token" \
  --symbol "MTK" \
  --decimals 7
```

### 3. Install the Deployed Contract
```bash
stellar registry install my-contract-instance
```

After installation, you can interact with the contract using `stellar-cli`:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id my-contract-instance -- --help
```

> You can deploy to testnet or mainnet depending on your `.env` and `environments.toml`.

## Concept: What Is the Contract Registry?
The registry is an on-chain smart contract that lets you:
* Publish and verify contract WASM binaries with versioning
* Deploy published contracts as named instances
* Manage multiple versions of the same contract
* Reuse deployed contracts across dApps

The registry separates the concepts of:
- **WASM publication**: Publishing reusable contract code
- **Contract deployment**: Creating instances of published contracts
- **Local installation**: Creating aliases for easy CLI access

>This means your contracts can be upgraded, shared, and used like packages.
