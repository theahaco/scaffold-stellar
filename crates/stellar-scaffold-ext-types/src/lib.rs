//! Shared types for stellar-scaffold extension hooks.
//!
//! Extensions are invoked as subprocesses. The scaffold tool serializes one of
//! these context types to JSON and writes it to the extension's stdin. The hook
//! name is communicated via the `STELLAR_SCAFFOLD_HOOK` environment variable.
//!
//! # Hook lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! pre-dev
//!   └─ pre-compile
//!        └─ [cargo build per contract]
//!   └─ post-compile
//!   └─ pre-deploy   (per contract)
//!        └─ [upload wasm, deploy/upgrade contract]
//!   └─ post-deploy  (per contract)
//!   └─ pre-codegen  (per contract)
//!        └─ [stellar contract bindings typescript + npm build]
//!   └─ post-codegen (per contract)
//! post-dev
//! ```
//!
//! Context types form a strict information superset going down the chain:
//! `CompileContext` ⊂ `DeployContext` ⊂ `CodegenContext`.
//! `ProjectContext` (used by `pre-dev`/`post-dev`) aggregates all per-contract
//! data into a single flat list.
