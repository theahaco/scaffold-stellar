# Quickstart

This section walks you through setting up Scaffold Stellar from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

| Tool                                                    | Description                                                   | Install Link                                                  |

| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)          | For running a Stellar node locally                            | Download from official site                                   |

### 1. Install the Scaffold Stellar CLI

```
cargo install stellar-scaffold-cli
```

The Scaffold Stellar CLI is installed as a plugin under the `stellar` CLI.

> We recommend the use of [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install pre-compiled binaries.

### 2. Create a New Project
```
stellar scaffold init my-project
cd my-project
```

### 3. Configure Your Frontend Environment
```
# Copy and configure environment variables for the frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your preferred network, and other settings.

### 4. Install Frontend Dependencies
```
# Install Frontend dependencies
npm install
```
### 5. Start Development
```
npm run dev
```
You should see your React frontend at http://localhost:5173.

### 6. For testnet/mainnet deployment:
```
# First publish your contract to the registry
stellar registry publish --wasm path/to/contract.wasm --wasm-name my-contract

# Then deploy an instance with constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name my-contract-instance \
  --wasm-name my-contract \
  -- \
  --param1 value1

# Can access the help docs for constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name my-contract-instance \
  --wasm-name my-contract \
  -- \
  --help

# Install the deployed contract locally for use with stellar-cli
stellar registry install my-contract-instance
```

## Project Layout
After scaffolding a project, your folder structure will look like this:

```
my-project/
├── contracts/            # Rust smart contracts (compiled to WASM)
├── packages/             # Auto-generated TypeScript contract clients
├── src/                  # React frontend code
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI pieces
│   ├── contracts/        # Contract interaction logic
│   ├── App.tsx           # Main app component
│   └── main.tsx          # Entry point
├── environments.toml     # Configuration per environment (dev/test/prod)
├── .env                  # Local environment variables
├── package.json          # Frontend packages
├── target/               # Build outputs
```

This template provides a ready-to-use frontend application with example smart contracts and their TypeScript clients. You can use these as reference while building your own contracts and UI. The frontend is set up with `Vite`, `React`, and includes basic components for interacting with the contracts.

See the [CLI Documentation](./cli.md) for detailed command information and the [Environments Guide](./environments.md) for configuration details.

## CLI Tools
Scaffold Stellar provides two main CLI tools:

**stellar-scaffold**
Initialize and manage dApp projects:
```
stellar scaffold init my-project
stellar scaffold build
```

**stellar-registry**
Manage contract deployment and versions:
```
stellar registry publish --wasm contract.wasm --wasm-name my-contract    # Publish contract to the registry
stellar registry deploy --contract-name instance --wasm-name my-contract # Deploy a contract instance
stellar registry install my-contract-instance                           # Install deployed contracts locally
```
> Use `--help` on any command for usage instructions.

## Smart Contract Deployment

### 1. Publish Your Contract
```bash
# Publish with automatic metadata extraction
stellar registry publish --wasm target/stellar/my_contract.wasm

# Or specify details manually
stellar registry publish \
  --wasm target/stellar/my_contract.wasm \
  --wasm-name my-contract \
  --binver "1.0.0"
```

### 2. Deploy the Contract
```bash
# Deploy without initialization
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name my-contract-instance \
  --wasm-name my-contract

# Deploy with constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name my-token \
  --wasm-name token \
  --version "1.0.0" \
  -- \
  --name "My Token" \
  --symbol "MTK" \
  --decimals 7
```

### 3. Install the Deployed Contract
```bash
stellar registry install my-contract-instance
```

After installation, you can interact with the contract using `stellar-cli`:
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id my-contract-instance -- --help
```

> You can deploy to testnet or mainnet depending on your `.env` and `environments.toml`.

Happy hacking!
