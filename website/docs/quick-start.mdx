# Quickstart

This section walks you through setting up Scaffold Stellar from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

| Tool | Description | Install Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) | For writing and compiling smart contracts | `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf \| sh` |
| [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) | For frontend development | Download from official site |
| [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli) | For building, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts | [`Link for the repo`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli) |
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) | For running a Stellar node locally | Download from official site |

### 1. Install the Scaffold Stellar CLI

```
cargo install --locked stellar-scaffold-cli
```

The Scaffold Stellar CLI is installed as a plugin under the `stellar` CLI.

> We recommend the use of [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install pre-compiled binaries.

### 2. Create a New Project

```
stellar scaffold init my-project
cd my-project
```

### 3. Configure Your Frontend Environment

Edit `.env` with your preferred network, and other settings.

### 4. Install Frontend Dependencies

```
# Install Frontend dependencies
npm install
```

### 5. Start Development

```
npm run dev
```

You should see your React frontend at http://localhost:5173.

### 6. For testnet/mainnet deployment:

The registry has two namespaces: **verified** (requires manager approval) and **unverified** (open to all). Use the `unverified/` prefix for the unverified registry:

```
# First publish your contract to the unverified registry
stellar registry publish --wasm path/to/contract.wasm --wasm-name unverified/my-contract --binver "1.0.0"

# Then deploy an instance with constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name unverified/my-contract-instance \
  --wasm-name unverified/my-contract \
  -- \
  --param1 value1

# Can access the help docs for constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name unverified/my-contract-instance \
  --wasm-name unverified/my-contract \
  -- \
  --help

# Create an alias the deployed contract locally for use with stellar-cli
stellar registry create-alias unverified/my-contract-instance
```

## Project Layout

After scaffolding a project, your folder structure will look like this:

```
my-project/
├── contracts/            # Rust smart contracts (compiled to WASM)
├── packages/             # Auto-generated TypeScript contract clients
├── src/                  # React frontend code
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI pieces
│   ├── contracts/        # Contract interaction logic
│   ├── App.tsx           # Main app component
│   └── main.tsx          # Entry point
├── environments.toml     # Configuration per environment (dev/test/prod)
├── .env                  # Local environment variables
├── package.json          # Frontend packages
├── target/               # Build outputs
```

This template provides a ready-to-use frontend application with example smart contracts and their TypeScript clients. You can use these as reference while building your own contracts and UI. The frontend is set up with `Vite`, `React`, and includes basic components for interacting with the contracts.

See the [CLI Documentation](./cli.md) for detailed command information and the [Environments Guide](./environments.md) for configuration details.

## CLI Tools

Scaffold Stellar provides two main CLI tools:

**stellar-scaffold** Initialize and manage dApp projects:

```
stellar scaffold init my-project
stellar scaffold build
```

**stellar-registry** Manage contract deployment and versions:

```
# Publish to unverified registry (no approval needed)
stellar registry publish --wasm contract.wasm --wasm-name unverified/my-contract

# Deploy a contract instance
stellar registry deploy --contract-name unverified/instance --wasm-name unverified/my-contract

# Install deployed contracts locally
stellar registry create-alias unverified/instance
```

> Use `--help` on any command for usage instructions. Use the `unverified/` prefix for open publishing.

---

## Smart Contract Deployment

The registry supports two namespaces:

- **Verified registry** (default) - Requires manager approval for initial publishes
- **Unverified registry** - Open for anyone to publish (use `unverified/` prefix)

### 1. Publish Your Contract

```bash
# Publish to the unverified registry (no approval needed)
stellar registry publish \
  --wasm target/stellar/my_contract.wasm \
  --wasm-name unverified/my-contract \
  --binver "1.0.0"
```

### 2. Deploy the Contract

```bash
# Deploy without initialization
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name unverified/my-contract-instance \
  --wasm-name unverified/my-contract

# Deploy with constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --contract-name unverified/my-token \
  --wasm-name unverified/token \
  --version "1.0.0" \
  -- \
  --name "My Token" \
  --symbol "MTK" \
  --decimals 7
```

### 3. Install the Deployed Contract

```bash
stellar registry create-alias unverified/my-contract-instance
```

After installation, you can interact with the contract using `stellar-cli`:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id my-contract-instance -- --help
```

> You can deploy to testnet or mainnet depending on your `.env` and `environments.toml`. Names are normalized (underscores → hyphens, lowercase).

Happy hacking!
