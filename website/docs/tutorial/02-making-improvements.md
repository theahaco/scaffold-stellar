# Making Some Basic Improvements

In our initial version, we had a problem: the `guess` function would crash if no number was set yet. Let's fix this by improving how our contract initializes and by creating reusable code for number generation.

## What We'll Accomplish

By the end of this step, you'll have:

- A contract that sets a number immediately upon deployment
- A private helper function for generating random numbers
- A more robust `reset` function that uses our helper
- Better error handling in the `guess` function

## ü™≤ Let's break the app!

To understand the bug in our code, let's trigger it. We'll do this by making a small change in `environments.toml`. On our way to finding the line we need to change, we'll learn more about how `environments.toml` works.

Open up `environments.toml` in your editor. Put it side-by-side with the output from `npm run start`. We'll walk through it bit by bit.

### 1. The Network

At the top, you'll see settings for the development network:

```toml
```toml
[development.network]
rpc-url = "http://localhost:8000/rpc"
network-passphrase = "Standalone Network ; February 2017"
run-locally = true
```

Every Stellar network is identified by a `network-passphrase`; it's like the fingerprint of the network and helps keep transactions cryptographically secure between networks. And you connect to any given Stellar network via a configurable `rpc-url`. If you look at the rest of `environments.toml`, every environment's network requires these settings. For our development environment, we also want to run the network locally. `run-locally` tells Scaffold CLI to use _Stellar_ CLI to run a local network container (`stellar container start`) and wait for it to finish startup before moving on to parse the rest of the `development` settings.

These settings correspond to the following `npm run start` output:

```
[0] ‚ÑπÔ∏è Starting local Stellar Docker container...
[0] ‚ÑπÔ∏è Starting local network
[0] ‚ÑπÔ∏è Using network at http://localhost:8000/rpc
```

### 2. The Accounts

Next you'll see this:

```toml
[[development.accounts]]
name = "me"
default = true
```

The double brackets, `[[ ... ]]`, are one way to [make an array in toml](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0-rc.2#array-of-tables). The snippet above tells Scaffold CLI to use Stellar CLI to generate a keypair for an account named "me" (`stellar keys generate me`) and set this account as the default for all transactions to follow.

If you wanted to create another named account/keypair to use throughout the rest of `environments.toml`, you could do so by adding another `[[development.accounts]]` block:

```toml
[[development.accounts]]
name = "alice"
```

If you look at the `npm run start` output again, this is the corresponding output:

```
[0] ‚ÑπÔ∏è Creating keys for "me"
[0] ‚úÖ Key saved with alias me in "~/.config/stellar/identity/me.toml"
[0] ‚úÖ Account me funded on "Standalone Network ; February 2017"
```

On subsequent runs, the key will already exist and the account will already be funded, and the output will tell you so.

### 3. The Contracts (aka "The Contract Clients")

This is what it's all about! You can think of everything in `environments.toml` as existing to configure contract clients.

Here's what that means: your frontend app relies on contracts. Depending on which version of your frontend you are using, those contracts will live on different networks. When you're working in your development environment, you probably want to use the local network (as configured in Scaffold Stellar by default). When you are ready to share an early, staging build of your app with others, you will probably use contracts deployed on Stellar's testnet. When you deploy your production app, you will make calls to mainnet contracts.

Scaffold Stellar encourages you to build separate versions of your frontend for each of these environments. And for each, you specify the contracts you rely on.

:::tip But wait. Isn't the behavior of a given contract the same across different networks? ü§îü§îü§î

If you think about the lifecycle of a contract like our Guess The Number game, you might imagine finalizing the contract, then deploying the exact same contract to your local network, to testnet, and even eventually to mainnet. Why does Scaffold Stellar and `environments.toml` make you specify the contract for each? Why does it rebuild the contract clients for each, as if they might be entirely different? Couldn't we just generate the contract client once, and then change the RPC URL and Network Passphrase that the client gets instantiated with?

In theory, this sounds reasonable. In practice, contracts rarely have the same exact implementation across different networks. Your local contract will have all the latest changes; it will be like your `main` branch. Messy, fast-paced, experimental. Your staging contract will be like a `beta` release‚Äîit will have stuff you haven't yet pushed to your main app. And even more, you could add feature flags to permanently ship different versions of your contract to staging and mainnet. Imagine a contract that adds admin backdoors in staging, but strips them out in production.

Scaffold Stellar wants to help you avoid bugs in all these situations. The contract clients are rebuilt for each environment, and they're built _in strict TypeScript_. So if you worked locally on a cool new feature with a smart contract method `my_cool_new_method`, and your frontend makes unguarded calls to this, then your frontend build for staging and production will fail, because those contracts don't implement `my_cool_new_method`.

:::

For staging and production, these must be live, deployed contracts. But in development, you are likely working on your contracts at the same time as your frontend! So the `development.contracts` handling has some allowances, some superpowers, that `staging.contracts` and `production.contracts` lack. Let's see:

```toml
[development.contracts.guess_the_number]
client = true

constructor_args = """
--admin me
"""

after_deploy = """
reset
"""
```

This is a [Toml table](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0-rc.2#table). See the TOML spec for other ways you could specify the same information.

Let's walk through this line by line:

- `[development.contracts.guess_the_number]`: this project only has one contract, so we can specify the settings for its contract clients here. You could also have a `[development.contracts]` with a more JSON-like specification for `guess_the_number` like `guess_the_number = { client = true, ‚Ä¶ }`.
- `guess_the_number`: this name must match the name of the contract specified in its `Cargo.toml` file, but in underscore-case. Compare it to the `name` field in `contracts/guess-the-number/Cargo.toml` and the generated Wasm files (`ls target/wasm32v1-none/release/*.wasm`).
- `client = true`: this tells Scaffold CLI to generate a contract client for this contract.
- `constructor_args`: the contract has a `constructor`, as we saw in the previous step. This `constructor_args` setting specifies the arguments to use when deploying & initializing the contract. You could deploy the contract yourself with:

  ```bash
  stellar contract deploy \
      --wasm-hash [find this in npm run start output] \
      --source me \
      -- \
      --admin me
  ```

  As you can see, the `constructor_args` get passed directly along to this `stellar contract deploy` command.

- `after_deploy`: calls to the contract to make after it gets deployed. Kind of like the `constructor_args`, these are specified using _only_ the part that comes after the `--` (this part of the command is sometimes called the "slop", so these `after_deploy` scripts are _slop only!_). The setting above results in Scaffold CLI making the following call, after deploying the contract:

  ```bash
  stellar contract deploy \
      --id guess_the_number
      --source me
      -- \
      reset
  ```

### Let's break it already!

That's it! That last line! That's how we break things. Go ahead and remove the `after_deploy` script entirely.

```diff
 constructor_args = """
 --admin me
 """
-
-after_deploy = """
-reset
-"""
```

Can you guess what will happen?

TODO: walk through it

## Understanding the Problem

In our current contract, the `__constructor` only sets the admin, but doesn't set an initial number. This means:

1. If someone calls `guess` before `reset`, it will crash with `unwrap()` on `None`
2. The number generation logic is only in `reset`, making it hard to reuse

Let's fix these issues!

## Step 1: üîí Create a Private Helper Function

First, let's extract the number generation into a private helper function. This follows the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) and makes our code more maintainable.

Open `contracts/guess-the-number/src/lib.rs` and add this private function inside the `impl GuessTheNumber` block:

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl GuessTheNumber {
    // ... existing functions ...

    /// Private helper function to generate and store a new random number
    fn set_random_number(env: &Env) {
        let new_number: u64 = env.prng().gen_range(1..=10);
        env.storage().instance().set(&THE_NUMBER, &new_number);
    }
}
```

### Understanding Private Functions

Notice that this function doesn't have `pub` in front of it - this makes it private. Private functions:

- Can only be called from within the same contract
- Don't become part of the contract's public API
- Are useful for internal logic and code reuse
- Help keep your contract interface clean and focused

## Step 2: üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Update the Constructor

Now let's modify the `__constructor` to set an initial number when the contract is deployed:

```rust
pub fn __constructor(env: &Env, admin: &Address) {
    Self::set_admin(env, admin);
    Self::set_random_number(env); // Add this line
}
```

### Why This Improves Things

By setting a number in the constructor:

1. **Immediate functionality**: The contract works right after deployment
2. **No crash risk**: `guess` will never encounter a missing number
3. **Better user experience**: Players can start guessing immediately

## Step 3: ‚ôªÔ∏è Update the Reset Function

Let's simplify our `reset` function to use the new helper:

```rust
/// Update the number. Only callable by admin.
pub fn reset(env: &Env) {
    Self::require_admin(env);
    Self::set_random_number(env);
}
```

Much cleaner! The logic is now centralized in our helper function. Note that this is still a public function, see the `pub`? The distinction between "public" and "private" might seem confusing here. Let's run the application and it should clear everything up:

```bash
$ npm start
```

In the header menu, you should see a `</> Debugger` link. This will open up our handy dandy Contract Explorer. This will let you explore all the contracts within your project, view the documentation for every method, and even invoke them with arguments directly from the UI!

This is a great tool to help debug and test while you develop. So give it a shot! Navigate to the debugger, select the `guess_the_number` contract, and test out our new `reset` method by hitting it's `Submit` button.

Our `reset` method is available to be called by code _outside_ our contract because we opted in to it being a public method with the `pub`. Our `set_random_number` is private by default, it's not even visible to the outside world. It's not listed in the Contract Explorer. It's not listed in the CLI help either:

```bash
$ stellar contract invoke --id guess_the_number --source me --network local -- help
Commands:
  reset    Update the number. Only callable by admin.
  guess    Guess a number between 1 and 10
  upgrade  Upgrade the contract to new wasm. Only callable by admin.
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

It would error if you tried to invoke it:

```bash
$ stellar contract invoke --id guess_the_number --source me --network local -- set_random_number
error: unrecognized subcommand 'set_random_number'
```

### Wait, So Anyone Can Call Reset?

Nope! Just because we made it public, we still require authentication so only admins can call it. Rust's idea of public vs private handles "where" the functions can be called. You still need to handle "who" calls it. That's why we set the contract admin in it's constructor method and check it with `Self::require_admin(env);`. Let's test it out and create a non-admin identity to see how it fails:

```bash
$ stellar keys generate bob --network local --fund
‚úÖ Key saved with alias bob in ".config/stellar/identity/bob.toml"
‚úÖ Account bob funded on "Standalone Network ; February 2017"

$ stellar contract invoke --id guess_the_number --source bob --network local -- reset
‚ùå error: Missing signing key for account GDAQWVA6REGN47BBCFY6SGQ4YTIGMDZZFHDOVUZXMVRAAT6OEZGCACGH
```

Alice is the admin, Bob is just a regular user. She can call `reset`, he gets an error.

## Step 4: ‚ö†Ô∏è Improve Error Handling

Speaking of errors, we should provide some helpful messages instead of just breaking when things go wrong. Let's make the `guess` function more robust by replacing `unwrap()` with `expect()`:

```rust
/// Guess a number between 1 and 10
pub fn guess(env: &Env, a_number: u64) -> bool {
    let stored_number = env.storage()
        .instance()
        .get::<_, u64>(&THE_NUMBER)
        .expect("No number has been set");

    a_number == stored_number
}
```

### Understanding `expect()` vs `unwrap()`

Because [Rust distinguishes between two types of errors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html), there's two different ways to handle them. Some errors are from bugs, and obviously we want to avoid these as much as possible. But some errors are expected. And we can recover from them without crashing. Both of these methods are shortcuts to check for values and error, but one gives you the ability to explain _why_:

- `unwrap()`: Crashes with a generic error message
- `expect()`: Crashes with your custom error message

Both will panic if the value is `None`, but `expect()` gives better debugging info. In our case, this should never happen since we now set a number in the constructor, but it's good defensive programming. For example, we were already using it in our `require_admin` method for authentication.

## Step 5: Your Complete Updated Contract

Here's what your `lib.rs` should look like now:

```rust
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, symbol_short, Address, BytesN, Env, Symbol};

#[contract]
pub struct GuessTheNumber;

const THE_NUMBER: Symbol = symbol_short!("n");
pub const ADMIN_KEY: &Symbol = &symbol_short!("ADMIN");

#[contractimpl]
impl GuessTheNumber {
    pub fn __constructor(env: &Env, admin: &Address) {
        Self::set_admin(env, admin);
        Self::set_random_number(env);
    }

    /// Update the number. Only callable by admin.
    pub fn reset(env: &Env) {
        Self::require_admin(env);
        Self::set_random_number(env);
    }

    /// Guess a number between 1 and 10
    pub fn guess(env: &Env, a_number: u64) -> bool {
        let stored_number = env.storage()
            .instance()
            .get::<_, u64>(&THE_NUMBER)
            .expect("No number has been set");

        a_number == stored_number
    }

    /// Private helper function to generate and store a new random number
    fn set_random_number(env: &Env) {
        let new_number: u64 = env.prng().gen_range(1..=10);
        env.storage().instance().set(&THE_NUMBER, &new_number);
    }

    /// Upgrade the contract to new wasm. Only callable by admin.
    pub fn upgrade(env: &Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
        Self::require_admin(env);
        env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash);
    }

    fn admin(env: &Env) -> Option<Address> {
        env.storage().instance().get(ADMIN_KEY)
    }

    fn set_admin(env: &Env, admin: &Address) {
        // Check if admin is already set
        if env.storage().instance().has(ADMIN_KEY) {
            panic!("admin already set");
        }
        env.storage().instance().set(ADMIN_KEY, admin);
    }

    fn require_admin(env: &Env) {
        let admin = Self::admin(env).expect("admin not set");
        admin.require_auth();
    }
}

mod test;
```

## Step 6: üß™ Test Your Improvements

Let's test that our improvements work. You should still have the `npm start` process running from earlier. If not, run it again and we can look a little closer at what it's doing. There's two concurrent processes:

1. `stellar scaffold watch --build-clients`: watches for any changes in your `contracts/` folders, then rebuilds and redeploys them
2. `vite`: watches for any changes in your `src/` folder and hot-reloads the UI

That means any time you add a method, tweak arguments, or even add documentation, everything is immediately reflected on the local network, your application in the browser, and in the Contract Explorer. Let's add some info to the `guess` method's documentation:

```rust
    /// Guess a number between 1 and 10, inclusive. Returns a boolean.
    pub fn guess(env: &Env, a_number: u64) -> bool {
```

As soon as you hit save, watch the Contract Explorer reload with the new text. Nifty, right? This massively speeds up your development time. But we can go even further.

### How to Write Unit Tests

TODO

## What We've Learned

In this step, we covered several important concepts:
1. Code Organization
	- **Private functions**: Help organize code and prevent external access to internal logic
	- **DRY principle**: Don't repeat yourself - extract common logic into reusable functions
2. Contract Lifecycle
	- **Immediate functionality**: Contracts should work right after deployment
	- **Consistent state**: Always ensure your contract is in a valid state
	- **Graceful degradation**: Handle edge cases so your contract doesn't crash
3. Error Handling
	- **expect() vs unwrap()**: Better error messages help with debugging

Our contract is now much more robust:

- ‚úÖ Works immediately after deployment
- ‚úÖ Clean, reusable code structure
- ‚úÖ Better error handling
- ‚ùå Still no authentication (anyone can guess)
- ‚ùå Still no transactions (how do you win the prize? what prize?)

## What's Next?

In the next step, we'll tackle authentication by:

- Converting `guess` from a view function to a transaction
- Requiring users to be signed in to guess
- Adding a `guesser` parameter to track who made each guess

This will prepare us for adding economic incentives in later steps!
